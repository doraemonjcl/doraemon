Hi! I'm Jacob Liang.
I work with Python, PHP, C++, JavaScript, Django, SQL, REST APIs, Git, AWS etc., with hands-on experience in software design, different levels of stack development, ambiguity navigation. I am reliable, resilient, collaborative, and committed to expanding emerging expertise and tackling problems. Some projects I/m working on are private or work-related.
